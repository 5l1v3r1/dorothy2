#Updating from Dorothy 1.0.x to >= 1.2.0##
#######################################

Dorothy 1.2.0 introduces several features that improve the overall framework.
Below, the recommended steps needed to update your Dorothy environment.

a) Remove the Dorothy configuration file
    rm ~/.dorothy.yml
   And recreate it by restarting Dorothy. You will see that the init script will ask you more question than before.

b) The last version of Dorothy modified the dorothive schema in order to let dorothive compatible with Sinatra and Rails.
The columns modified are the following:
    samples.hash -> sample.sha256
    traffic_dumps.hash -> traffic_dumps.sha256
You can modify them manually if you have already a Dorothy version up and running, or drop the database and recreate it using the updated .ddl .
