#Updating from Dorothy 1.x to >= 2.0.0##
#######################################

Dorothy 2.0.0 introduces several features that improve the overall framework.
As it is a major update (since 1.2.0), it is not compatible this previous versions, thus it is highly recommended to redo
 all the installation procedure. If you have been using Dorothy for a while and you have its DB full of precious data that you
 like to keep on the newer version, please drop me an email and we'll try to find a solution. Keep in mind that also the
 Dorothive schema has changed, thus a you should create a new DB for this dorothy version.
