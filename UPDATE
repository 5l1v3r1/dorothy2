#Updating from Dorothy 1.0.x to >= 1.0.9##
#######################################

Dorothy 1.0.9 introduces several features that improve the overall framework.
Below, the recommended steps needed to update your Dorothy environment.

a) Remove the Dorothy configuration file
    rm ~/.dorothy.yml
   And recreate it by restarting Dorothy. You will see that the init script will ask you more question than before.

b) Since a new configuration file has been added in your Dorothy's etc/ folder (extension.yml), go and edit it
   accordingly to your environment.

c) From Dorothy home, execute the following SQL script in order to update the database schema. It will add the new table sys_procs.

sudo -u postgres psql dorothive -f share/update_dorothive.sql

That's all! You are ready to go!
